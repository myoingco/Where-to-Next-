## Introduction
In this personal project, I decided to make an interactive map of previous places I have travelled to. 


## Getting Started

Prior to execution, you must have VS Code. You must also have your travel data properly cleaned, prepared and converted into a JSON file.


## Build Process

Complete the following steps:

1) Create a CSV file of all the places you have travelled to with the following columns, add or delete if needed:
    - Name of Place
    - City 
    - Country
    - Latitude
    - Longitude

2) Convert the CSV file into a JSON file utilizing Python.

3) Create the HTML file to structure the web page.
    
4) Create the CSS file to style and customize the HTML elements.

5) Create the JavaScript file to customize the interactivity of the map. For this project I utilized 'OpenStreetMap' paired with the Leaflet.js library.

6) Deploy your app to a free static page hosting service, such as GitHub Pages. Submit the links to your deployment and your GitHub repo. Ensure that your repository has regular commits and a thorough README.md file
